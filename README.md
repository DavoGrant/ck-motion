## Overview
ck-motion is a repository containing the code for analysing the outflows and
dynamics of binary star components exhibiting powerful winds. The core algorithm
is a semi-analytical model which encapsulates the dynamics associated with
extended emission, encoding the net velocity field of the out-flowing gas in
terms of a convolution of past motion due to the finite flow speed of the wind.
